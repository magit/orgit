This package defines several Org link types which can be used to link to certain
Magit buffers.

    orgit:/path/to/repo/           links to a `magit-status' buffer
    orgit-log:/path/to/repo/::REV  links to a `magit-log' buffer
    orgit-rev:/path/to/repo/::REV  links to a `magit-commit' buffer

Such links can be stored from corresponding Magit buffers using the command
`org-store-link`.

When an Org file containing such links is exported, then the url of the remote
configured with `orgit-remote` is used to generate a web url according to
`orgit-export-alist`.  That webpage should present Package-Version:
20150525.1140 approximately the same information as the Magit buffer would.

Both the remote to be considered the public remote, as well as the actual web
urls can be defined in individual repositories using Git variables.

To use a remote different from `orgit-remote` but still use
`orgit-export-alist` to generate the web urls, use:

`$ git config orgit.remote REMOTE-NAME`

To explicitly define the web urls, use something like:

    git config orgit.status http://example.com/repo/overview
    git config orgit.log http://example.com/repo/history/%r
    git config orgit.rev http://example.com/repo/revision/%r
