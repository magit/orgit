* Link to Magit buffers from Org documents

This package defines several Org link types, which can be used to link to certain Magit buffers. Use the command =org-store-link= while such a buffer is current to store a link. Later you can insert it into an Org buffer using the command =org-insert-link=.

** Format
The three link types defined here take these forms:

| =orgit:/path/to/repo/=           | \rightarrow | magit-status buffer   |
| =orgit-log:/path/to/repo/::REV=  | \rightarrow | magit-log buffer      |
| =orgit-rev:/path/to/repo/::ARGS= | \rightarrow | magit-revision buffer |

Before =v1.3.0= only the first revision was stored in =orgit-log= links, and all other revisions were discarded. All other arguments
were also discarded and Magit's usual mechanism for determining the switches and options was used instead.

For backward compatibility, and because it is the common case and looks best, =ARGS= by default has the form =REV= as before.
However if linking to a log buffer that shows the log for multiple revisions, then =("REV"...)= is used instead. If
=orgit-log-save-arguments= is non-nil, then =(("REV"...) ("ARG"...) [("FILE"...)])= is always used, which allows restoring
the buffer most faithfully.

** Export

When an Org file containing such links is exported, then the url of the remote configured with =orgit-remote= is used to
generate a web url according to =orgit-export-alist=. That webpage should present approximately the same information as
the Magit buffer would.

Both the remote to be considered the public remote, as well as the actual web urls can be defined in individual repositories
using Git variables.

To use a remote different from =orgit-remote= but still use =orgit-export-alist= to generate the web urls, use:

#+begin_src conf
  git config orgit.remote REMOTE-NAME
#+end_src

To explicitly define the web urls, use something like:

| =git config orgit.status http://example.com/repo/overview= |
| =git config orgit.log http://example.com/repo/history/%r=  |
| =git config orgit.rev http://example.com/repo/revision/%r= |
